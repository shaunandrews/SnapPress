This app is called SnappPress. It allows me to take screenshots and upload them to
my WordPress site. The URL is saved to my clipboard, and I can paste it anywhere
for others to see, like in my work Slack chat.

Here's a few things to note:

- This is an Electron app.
- The app connects to a WordPress site using the WordPress REST API.
